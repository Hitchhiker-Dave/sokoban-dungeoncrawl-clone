Tutorial Levels (1-)
1: Teaches Basic Movement
2: Teaches How to Move Rocks
3: Teaches that different characters have different uses, the rogue's use is that they disarms traps
4: Teachs that the fighter blocks arrows; player MUST learn how to switch characters
	-Could I make a simpler version w/out the skeleton as a simpler tutorial, then reuse this level later?
