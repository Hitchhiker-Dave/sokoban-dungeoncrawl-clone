Color Palette is Pico-8 Secret Palette:  https://lospec.com/palette-list/pico-8-secret-palette
For project the topic itself should say something about video games (I can still mash it up with one of the other topics)
- I.e. how video games (the medium) effect remediation, or embodiment; gonna have to brainstorm

Note: Fix both Return to Level Select in Level x and Instant Exit issue by making a seperate menu that exists for each level
with options to return to level select or skip to the next level, and pressing a button toggles it's invisiblity
-Can also do the same with a "End of Level" report
